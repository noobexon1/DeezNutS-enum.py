** DNS Server Types **

    1) Recursive Resolver:

        # Acts as an agent between the client and the NS.
        # process:
            * wait for a DNS query from a web client.
            * either:

                1) query can be resolved with cached data.
                2) Sends entry back to client.

                OR

                1) Sends query to a Root NS.
                2) Receive response from Root NS.
                3) Using the response to send a query to the appropriate TLD NS.
                4) Receive response from TLD NS.
                4) Using the response to send a query to the Authoritative NS.
                5) receive response from Authoritative NS.
                6) Sends entry back to client.

    2) Root NS:

       # There are 13 Root NS worldwide at the moment.
       # This is the first stop of the Recursive Resolver to search for DNS entries.

    3) TLD NS:

       # Manages all domains that have the same TLD (.net, .com, .gov etc...).

    4) Authoritative NS:

       # Store DNS records information for domains.



** DNS Structure **

    - <Top-Level-Domain-1>.
        - <Domain-1>.
            - <Sub-Domain-1.1>.
            - <Sub-Domain-1.2>.
            .
            .
        - <Domain-2>.
        .
        .




** DNS Zone Types **

    1) Primary DNS Server:

       # Contains 'Zone File' which contains authoritative info for a domain.
       # Responsible for administrating the zone and updating the secondary DNS servers.
       # Zone's DNS records can only be edited here.

    2) Secondary DNS Server:

       # Contains Read-Only copies of the zone file of the primary DNS server.
       # Serves as a backup server for the primary DNS server.




** Zone Files **

    # Contains a list of entries for the corresponding domain.
    # Entry is of the format:  <Domain's-IP>   <Domain-name>
    # Zone file can only have one Primary DNS server.
    # Zone file can have as many Secondary DNS Servers as needed.
    # Local zone file path on linux is '/etc/hosts'.




** Zone Transfer & Types **

    # It is the creation and transfer of the zone file from the primary DNS server to the secondary DNS server.
    # Does not require authentication.
    # There are 2 types of zone transfers:

        1) AXFR - Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone:

            # Complete copy and transfer of all the entries from the zone file found at Primary DNS server.

        2) IXFR - Incremental Zone Transfer:

            # Only the changed and new DNS records of the zone file are copied and transferred.



** Record Types **

    A	  ->   IP Version 4 Address records.
    AAAA  ->   IP Version 6 Address records.
    CNAME ->   Canonical Name records.
    HINFO ->   Host Information records.
    ISDN  ->   Integrated Services Digital Network records.
    MX	  ->   Mail exchanger record.
    NS	  ->   Name Server records.
    PTR	  ->   Reverse-lookup Pointer records.
    SOA	  ->   Start of Authority records.
    TXT	  ->   Text records.
